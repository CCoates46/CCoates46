//1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
//2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
//by 1.6)
//3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
//converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
//4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
//methods, and with the getter and setter.


//Test data:
//ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
