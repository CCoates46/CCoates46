/*
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'.
A car has a 'make' and a  'speed' property.
 The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the
 car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's 
speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 
'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h


const Car = function(make, speed) {
    this.make = make
    this.speed = speed
}

Car.prototype.accelerate = function() {
    const increasedSpeed = this.speed += 10
    console.log(`The new speed for the ${this.make} is ${increasedSpeed} km/h`)
}

Car.prototype.brake = function () {
    const decreasedSpeed = this.speed -= 5
    console.log(`the new speed for the ${this.make} is ${decreasedSpeed} km/h`)
}
const car1 = new Car('BMW', 120)
const car2 = new Car('Mercedes', 95)


car1.accelerate()
car1.accelerate()
car1.brake()
car1.accelerate()

car2.accelerate()
car2.brake()
car2.brake()
